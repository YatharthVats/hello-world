# hello-world
Lets follow the tradition and create our first repo

I really want to make new discoveries and look at the world from a secluded yet refreshing perspective.

I believe that computer engineering will help humanity in countless ways and i wish to explore as many as possible.

How about you? Care to share some thoughts? :)
